Hi! I'm looking to sublet my oversized single room in a 5 bedroom, 2 full bath, 2 floor spacious apartment in the Symphony area (Boston, MA 02115) during Summer 1 (May and June).  Great location, 5-10 minute walk from Northeastern campus. Rent is $1,687.50/month plus electric/internet â€“ heat and hot water included in the rent. There is central air, free private laundry, and a beautiful modern kitchen. There will be an official sublet agreement with the realtor that we originally used, which we would be splitting the fee of $500 for. Currently all male roommates but all are welcome - please message me or contact [ckobyluck@aol.com](mailto:ckobyluck@aol.com) if interested! See photos below.
